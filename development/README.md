# PyTorch with practical examples

This development stage tests the use of PyTorch. In the below we can
learn about
- Tensors
- Dataset and Data Loaders
- Transforms
- Build the Neural Network
- Automatic differentiation
- Optimizing the model
- Save and load the model

This stage is in line with the phase of learning machine learning. The complete 
neural network code is in the `final_neural_network.ipynb` file.

# Install dependencies
- Ensure that the following libraries are installed
- `torchvision` `torch`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`
- if you're using a virtual environment, you can easily install the above using `pip install torch`
