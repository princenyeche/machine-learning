# Neural Network & Deep Learning

 A study path towards neural network and deep learning. A branch of the machine learning pathway.
 
In this study path, we'll look into

- What is Neural Network
  - Supervised learning
  - Unsupervised learning
- Binary Classification
  - Finding the probability between 0 and 1
- Logistic Regression
  - A very small neural network
  - Logistic Regression cost function 
- Gradient descent algorithm
- Backpropagation
- Forward propagation
- Vectorization 
- Cost function
- Broadcasting 
- Update parameters

We'll employ the use of two Python libraries `numpy` and `pandas` for data
wrangling and analysis. Then walk our way towards using `Pytorch` to build, train
and evaluate deep learning models such as:

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
